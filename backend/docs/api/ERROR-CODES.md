# Chioma API Error Codes

All error responses use a stable machine-readable `error` code alongside the HTTP status. Clients should branch on `error`, not `message` — messages may be localised or refined over time.

## Error Response Shape

```json
{
  "statusCode": 422,
  "error": "PAYMENT_AMOUNT_BELOW_MINIMUM",
  "message": "Payment amount must be at least 1 stroop.",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-01T09:30:00Z",
  "path": "/api/payments",
  "requestId": "req_a1b2c3d4"
}
```

## Handling Validation Errors

When `VALIDATION_ERROR` is returned, a `details` array describes each field error:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Request validation failed",
  "details": [
    { "field": "amountStroops", "message": "amountStroops must be a positive integer" },
    { "field": "memo", "message": "memo must not exceed 28 characters" }
  ]
}
```

## Adding a New Error Code

1. Add the code and description to the appropriate table above.
2. Throw using the project's `AppException` helper so the global filter picks it up:

```typescript
throw new AppException('AGREEMENT_NOT_FOUND', HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, {
  agreementId,
});
```

3. Add a corresponding `@ApiResponse` decorator to the affected endpoint(s).
